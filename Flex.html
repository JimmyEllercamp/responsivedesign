      <p>Another method for responsive design which streamlines all positioning and sizing of child elements significantly easier, is the Flex Box (display: flex)</p><br>

              <th><strong>Syntax</strong></th>
              <th><strong>Method</strong></th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><em>display: flex;</em></td>
              <td>Setting a div's display property to flex will still keep the div as a block level element, but the child elements will become responsive to the div's parameters, and will display as inline within that div. Following are a variety of ways to style the child elements within the div.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><em>display: inline-flex;</em></td>
              <td>If you want to have multiple flex containers displayed next to each other, you can set the display property to inline-flex. This will still keep the child elements inline.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><em>justify-content</em></td>
            <td>Justify-content will allow us to style the child elements in different positions horizontally within the flex box. Values we can assign to justify-content are as follows: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around and space-between. They will position the child elements as the names suggest, on the left, right, in the middle, with equal space around each child element, and with equal space between, but none at the start and the end of the div.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>align-items</em></td>
            <td>Another property: value pair we can use can now position the child elements vertically. They are: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline (the bottom of the content will all be aligned), and stretch (which is the default value. Setting height and width properties will override the stretch setting).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>flex-grow</em></td>
            <td>Flex child elements will automatically shrink in response to the size of the parent flex container, but will not grow. This is because flex-grow is by default set to 0. With this we can specify if any or all content should grow to fill the container as the container grows. If there are two elements next to each other, the first with a flex-grow value of 1, and the second with a value of 2, the second element will grow twice as fast as the first element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>flex-shrink</em></td>
            <td>Just the same as flex-grow, flex-shrink allows us to control which elements shrink with the container and at what speed. It uses the same value system.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>flex-basis</em></td>
            <td>Flex-Basis allows us to specify the size of a flex child element before it stretches or shrinks to fill its parent container. This is specified in pixles. This can be particularly useful if being used with flex-wrap. If you don't want elements to shrink past a certain point in response to the parent flex container, you can set the min size and set flex-shrink to 0, and assign flex-wrap for it to go to the next line.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>flex</em></td>
            <td>Thankfully, the flex property allows us to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis all in one line, like when declaring margins or padding, or a border. The order and syntax goes like this: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis. This looks like this: flex: 1 2 150px;. You can also set just grow and shrink, or just grow and basis, but you cannot ignore grow and set only shrink and basis. <strong>Note:</strong> there is a flex property, <em>and</em> a flex value. They are not the same.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>flex-wrap</em></td>
            <td>flex-wrap is a property to be declared on a flex container, when we don't want the elements to shrink responsively to fit the container. There are three possible values we can assign a flex-wrap property: <strong>wrap, wrap-reverse</strong> and <strong>nowrap.</strong> Wrap causes any overflowing elements to be moved to the following line, instead of everything shrinking to fit inline. wrap-reverse takes the last overflowing element and adds it in the line above, thereby wrapping in reverse. nowrap is the default, and is only used to override other css styling causing wrap.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>align-content</em></td>
            <td>Now that we have wrapping content, we might have more lines of elements than just one. align-items is only used for a single line. If we have multiple lines, we use align-content. The syntax is as follows: <strong>flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-between</strong> and <strong>stretch.</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>flex-direction</em></td>
            <td>flex containers and items are positioned according to a main axis and a cross axis, or horizontally and vertically. With flex-direction, we can specify which way we want them to be styled. Flex-direction can take one of 4 possible values: <strong>row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse</strong>. Row is the default, row-reverse plays the elements backwards from the top right corner of the container, column displays downwards on top of each other, and column-reverse displays from the bottom up in reverse.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>flex-flow</em></td>
            <td>Similar to the <strong>flex</strong> property, flex-flow is used to declare flex-direction and flex-wrap in a single line. It is written in the order of direction, and the wrap. (<strong>flex-flow: column wrap</strong>;) The flex-flow property is declared on flex containers.</td>
        </tr>
